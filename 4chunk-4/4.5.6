1. The first exmaple was 60 Milliseconds and the second was 19 Milliseconds. 
2. The for loop was faster because I tested the examples each twice and both times the for loop was faster. The other test concluded for loop at 3 milliseconds and while loop at 4 milliseconds.
3. I think this is becasue while loops check the iteration for each iteration.
